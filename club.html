      <h3>Beginning of the Club</h3>
        <h4>The club was founded (approximately 8-12 members). Competing for Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC), the club gained experience with designing and building rockets and parachutes from scratch. Unfortunately, we missed the qualifying score by 0.2 points.</h4>

      <h3>TARC</h3>
      <p>Team of about 12 members applied the experience and knowledge gained; We qualified for TARC Finals and traveled to Manassas, VA. The Seattle Art Museum provided materials and training in packing rocket for cross-country travel. Our teams placed 29th out of the 100 qualifying teams at Finals.</p>

      <h3>Growth</h3>
      <p>Membership grew to 21 and fielded three teams: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie. Experimentation in rocket design, materials and parachute design expanded. All three teams qualified for Finals, travel to Manassas, and placed 7th (Charlie), 24th (Bravo) and 58th (Alpha), securing the Club‚Äôs first NASA contract, via NASA's Student Launch (SL) program, to build a Sounding Rocket. </p>

      <p class="timeline-event-thumbnail">2009 - 2010</p>
      <h3>Four TARC Teams</h3>
      <p>Membership grew to field four Ingraham teams (Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo; Team Alpha was retired to the Hall of Fame) for TARC and one SL (NASA) team. SL Team Rainier experimented with new materials such as ‚Äòblue tube‚Äô and constructing fins from ‚Äúscratch‚Äù using plywood, fiberglass and Kevlar-carbon fiber weave; and continued as the only team to design and make their own parachutes by hand, in a field of 37 University and high school team colleagues at NASA‚Äôs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL.  The scientific payload was an on-board set of gyroscopes and measuring devices to measure the effect of counter-balancing x-y vectors on rocket stability.  This year, the TARC criteria changed from using parachutes to streamers. The tradition of hand-made, sewn parachutes was put aside for the experimentation and data gathering with streamers for the new TARC criterion.  All four teams qualified for Finals, and return with 4th- (Charlie), 10th- (Bravo), 26th- (Delta) and 58th- (Echo) place standings. This was the first time in TARC history that two teams from the same high school place in the top 10.  NASA awarded two SL contracts to the Club.</p>

      <h3>Five TARC Teams</h3>
        <h4>Five teams (Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot) are fielded for TARC, and two for SL (Team Olympus and Team Adams).  Rocket motors from the supplier were discovered to be defective (on a ‚ÄúRecall‚Äù list, but no notification letters were received) after a rushed season of repeated failures in test launches at 60 Acres Park in Redmond.  As a sad consequence, none of the TARC teams qualified for Finals.  Teams Olympus and Adams designed two different SL rockets for NASA, with on-board experiments of measuring radioactivity at different altitudes on descent, and investigating crystallization of Field‚Äôs Metal under zero gravity (at apogee).  Interim Reviews and Reports with NASA went well until Team Adams encountered an unexpected design consequence of instability as the rocket mass changed during flight.  Adams‚Äô ‚ÄúFlight Readiness Review‚Äù scrubbed the mission, but both teams traveled to Huntsville, AL, to launch Olympus in a flawless flight. </h4>

      <h3>New Adviser</h3>
      <p>Five teams were fielded by Ingraham Rocket Club under new Adviser, Kurt Spann, and Mentors Carl Hamilton, Julian Picard (alumnus) and Patrick Ma (alumnus).  One NASA SL contract was continued, with Team Cascade steadily meeting Review deadlines.  After traveling to Huntsville, AL, Team Cascade successfully launched on April 22. Rockets designed and built by Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo and Foxtrot are ready for launch in March, in advance of the TARC April 2 deadline. Competing against nearly 700 teams nationwide, including 11 other teams from the state of Washington, two teams from Ingraham (Echo and Foxtrot) were included in the 100 TARC finalists selected to compete near Washington, D.C., on May 12. During competition on May 12, Team Foxtrot qualified for the finals, eventually placing 15th in the nation and ensuring a spot in NASA's 2013 SL challenge.</p>

      <h3>Continuing</h3>
      <p>New and returning rocketeers continued to learn, teach, and fly. In spring of 2015, Teams Delta and Foxtrot qualified for TARC National Flyoff. Team Foxtrot took 3rd in the nation, and Team Delta finished 21st (see below for more information ). As a result of the 3rd Place finish, the Club became one the handful of high school groups invited by NASA to submit a proposal for the 2016 Student Launch. </p>

        <h3>Team Foxtrot Takes Third Place at the 2015 TARC Nationals</h3>
        <h4>Ingraham's Teams Foxtrot and Delta had an excellent showing at the Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC)  in The Plains, VA, on Saturday, May 9, 2015. Team Foxtrot, after scoring a 1 in the first round, placed third in this national competition sponsored by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA). TARC is the AIA's flagship program designed to encourage students to study and pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

After the first round in the competition, the two Ingraham High School Rocket Club teams were in 1st and 12th place, with scores of 1 and 17.32 (a 0 is a perfect score). Team Foxtrot was docked one point for missing the target altitude of 800 feet by 1 foot. In the final round, afternoon thermals and new flight criteria created challenges for both teams, and, in the end, Foxtrot finished in 3rd place and Team Delta placed 21st. For their feat, Foxtrot earned $12,500 in scholarships, a framed flag that orbited in NASA‚Äôs newest Orion spaceship, and $1,000 for the school.<br>

Roughly 700 teams competed in TARC, with the top 100 in the nation attending the National finals. Ingraham has a strong history of success at TARC, sending 12 teams to the finals in the club‚Äôs 9-year history. After missing the finals the past 2 years, they‚Äôre excited to have sent the whole club to the finals this year. And with only 2 seniors graduating from the club ‚Äì and the club‚Äôs best ever finish ‚Äì they look forward to more success this coming year.<br>

Qualification in the TARC Nationals is something to be very proud of. Delta and Foxtrot qualified for Nationals with launches that all came within 3 feet of the target altitude, and only one missed the target duration ‚Äì by 1 second. At the National Flyoff on May 9 in The Plains, VA, Team Foxtrot placed #3 and Team Delta #21. Teams that place in the top 10 win scholarship money as well as $1,000 for the school, not to mention pyro-technical glory and bragging rights! The Ingraham teams were two of the only three high school teams from Washington State to qualify this year. Since the Club was founded in 2006, 12 Ingraham teams have qualified for TARC Nationals, and 4 of those teams placed in the top 10. In fact, in 2010, Team Charlie came in #4 in the nation, and Team Bravo came in 10th--the first time in the Competition's history that two teams from the same high school scored in the top 10. <br>

As a result of Team Foxtrot's 3rd Place finish in 2015, the Ingraham students are one of eight high school teams invited to submit a proposal for the 2016 "Student Launch," a NASA-sponsored event in which college teams (as well as high-scoring TARC teams) design, build, and launch a high-power rocket, carrying a scientific payload, to an altitude of 5,280 feet and return in recoverable and reusable condition.<br>


More recently, the club has participated in the Student Launch Initiative. This is a program which 9 high schools and a number of universities compete in that is sponsored by NASA. Ingraham's team Constance flew successfully at this on April 16, 2016. </h4>

      <h3>New People</h3>
      <p>With 7 new members, the club roughly doubled in size. Three teams (Delta, Echo, and Sierra) were fielded for TARC and 9 members participate in the 2016 Student Launch. To read more about our 2016 Student Launch Project, click here. Unfortunately, none of our three teams qualified for TARC finals. However, our achievements at Student Launch were recognized by the Seattle Times. </p>

      <h3>Mr. Spann</h3>
      <p>Mr. Spann transferred his advisory position to Mr. Fisher. The club decided that Echo is a cursed name. Hence our three TARC teams were named Jupiter, Sierra, and India. 3 of our new members participated in Project Shuksan, which added up to 9 of us participating in the 2017 Student Launch. </p>

      <h3>Project Silver Star</h3>
      <p>This year while dealing with TARC, we've decided to start on a new high power rocket build. After many hours sanding and epoxying the airframe, the carbon fiber rocket known as Silver Star was complete. It was successful on a L-motor and reached around 12,000ft! In addition, the rocket theoretically has achieved mach 1.2, faster than the speed of sound.</p>
